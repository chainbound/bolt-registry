/**
 * @dev Wrappers over Solidity's uintXX/intXX casting operators with added overflow
 * checks.
 *
 * Downcasting from uint256/int256 in Solidity does not revert on overflow. This can
 * easily result in undesired exploitation or bugs, since developers usually
 * assume that overflows raise errors. `SafeCast` restores this intuition by
 * reverting the transaction when such an operation overflows.
 *
 * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire
 * class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.
 *
 * Can be combined with {SafeMath} and {SignedSafeMath} to extend it to smaller types, by performing
 * all math on `uint256` and `int256` and then downcasting.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```solidity
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }
 * ```

 * @title Adds pausability to a contract, with pausing & unpausing controlled by the `pauser` and `unpauser` of a PauserRegistry contract.
 * @author Layr Labs, Inc.
 * @notice Terms of Service: https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/overview/terms-of-service
 * @notice Contracts that inherit from this contract may define their own `pause` and `unpause` (and/or related) functions.
 * These functions should be permissioned as "onlyPauser" which defers to a `PauserRegistry` for determining access control.
 * @dev Pausability is implemented using a uint256, which allows up to 256 different single bit-flags; each bit can potentially pause different functionality.
 * Inspiration for this was taken from the NearBridge design here https://etherscan.io/address/0x3FEFc5A4B1c02f21cBc8D3613643ba0635b9a873#code.
 * For the `pause` and `unpause` functions we've implemented, if you pause, you can only flip (any number of) switches to on/1 (aka "paused"), and if you unpause,
 * you can only flip (any number of) switches to off/0 (aka "paused").
 * If you want a pauseXYZ function that just flips a single bit / "pausing flag", it will:
 * 1) 'bit-wise and' (aka `&`) a flag with the current paused state (as a uint256)
 * 2) update the paused state to this new value
 * @dev We note as well that we have chosen to identify flags by their *bit index* as opposed to their numerical value, so, e.g. defining `DEPOSITS_PAUSED = 3`
 * indicates specifically that if the *third bit* of `_paused` is flipped -- i.e. it is a '1' -- then deposits should be paused

 * @notice Terms of Service: https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/overview/terms-of-service
 * @notice  This is the contract for delegation in EigenLayer. The main functionalities of this contract are
 * - enabling anyone to register as an operator in EigenLayer
 * - allowing operators to specify parameters related to stakers who delegate to them
 * - enabling any staker to delegate its stake to the operator of its choice (a given staker can only delegate to a single operator at a time)
 * - enabling a staker to undelegate its assets from the operator it is delegated to (performed as part of the withdrawal process, initiated through the StrategyManager)
